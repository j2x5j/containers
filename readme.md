# Containers
These Dockerfiles were made mainly to experiment with container technologies for school exercises and such, they're nothing serious and mainly exist to mess around with Docker or Podman for [Red Hat Academy](rha.ole.redhat.com) courses **DO180** and **DO188**.

This repository was made for yet another school assignment.
